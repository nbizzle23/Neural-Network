 Constructing a [neural network](https://rpubs.com/nburke2/638748) to analyse which factors go into PER
 
## Getting Started

This code can directly inputted into your on your local machine to produce the resulting html and images . See section below on how to replicated this project in RStudio.

### Prerequisites

These are the packages you need to install as well the installation process 

```
instal.packages(magrittr) 
install.packages(janitor) 
install.packages(scales) 
install.packages(ballr)
install.packages(knitr)
install.packages(dplyr)
install.packages(ggplot2)
install.packages(ggthemes)
install.packages(caTools)
install.packages(knitr)
install.packages(devtools)

```

### Installing

Once these packages and the necessary dependencies have been installed called this libraries in your console 

```
library (magrittr) 
library (janitor) 
library (scales) 
library(ballr)
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
library(caTools)
library(knitr)
library(devtools)

Will be able to recreate this html document.
